# Project Description
This project is intended as a collaborative effort between myself and a friend.<br>
The intent is to create a personal blog for his use, focusing mostly on coffee and related topics.<br>
For me, the idea is to gain experience utilizing AWS and Ghost.<br>

# Notes
This represents more theory than practice at this point, but I hope to regain my friend's interest in the project.<br>
